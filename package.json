  "description": "This project aims to develop a command-line application specifically designed for freelance web developers. The application's primary function is to generate basic logos for their projects, eliminating the need for paid graphic design services. Through a series of prompts, users will be able to input their desired text, colour preferences, and shape choices. Based on this input, the application will create a corresponding SVG logo file named \"logo.svg\". This logo will be visually represented as a 300x200 pixel image that adheres to the user's specified criteria. Ultimately, this project seeks to offer a cost-effective solution for freelance web developers to create simple, yet personalised logos for their projects.",
